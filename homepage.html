    <h2>Professional Passions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Advocating for equitable accessability of care for vulnerable populations.
                </br></br>Generally, access to health care is the timely use of personal health services to achieve the best health outcomes, e.g. living longer with a higher quality of life.
                    </br>There are four main components of access of care according to Healthy People 2020, visit https://www.ahrq.gov/research/findings/nhqrdr/chartbooks/access/elements.html for more information.
                        <ul>
                    <li>Coverage: how a patient enters into the health care system. Uninsured people are less likely to receive medical care and more likely to have worse health outcomes.</li>
                    <li>Services: having a usual and reliable source of care is associated with adults receiving recommended screenings and preventive health services.</li>
                    <li>Timeliness: ability to provide health care when the need is recognized.</li>
                    <li>Workforce: capable, qualified, culturally competent providers. I would personally add that an availability of specialist providers by region is also an important factor.</li>
                        </ul>
                </li>
            </br>
                <li>Seniors' quality of care and elder fraud and abuse prevention</li>
            </br>    
                <li>Connecting patients with the tools they need to be the center of the care team model</li>
            </br>    
                <li>Advocating for patient quality care</li>
            </br>

                    <p>10 years ago, my husband and I actually met each other online playing an MMO called Tera - which is sadly shut down now.

                <p>During the pandemic, I needed an escape and discovered gardening. My husband and I work on the yard together, we maintain the landscaping, and we love planting different varieties of plants each season. Gardening has been such a therapeutic benefit.</p>
