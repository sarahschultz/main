    <p>
    Generally, access to health care is the timely use of personal health services to achieve the best health outcomes, e.g. living longer with a higher quality of life.
    </br>
    </br>There are four main components of access of care according to Healthy People 2020. (Visit: <a href="https://www.ahrq.gov/research/findings/nhqrdr/chartbooks/access/elements.html"> the AHRQ homepage here </a>for additional information.).
    </p>
<ol>
    <li>Coverage:  how a patient enters into the health care system. Uninsured people are less likely to receive medical care and more likely to have worse health outcomes.
    </li>
    <li>Services:  having a usual and reliable source of care is associated with adults receiving recommended screenings and preventive health services.
    </li>
    <li>Timeliness:  ability to provide health care when the need is recognized.
    </li>
    <li>Workforce:  capable, qualified, culturally competent providers. I would personally add that an availability of specialist providers by region is also an important factor.
    </li>
